# README file for the GAP package Origami

This package provides calculations for origamis, also called square-tiled surfaces. This are translation surfaces, obtained by gluing the edges of squares. These surfaces can equivalently be described as coverings of a torus. 
This package calcultates basic properties of origamis as stratum and genus. The main feature of the package is the calculation of Vech groups of origamis.

## Using the package

Copy the package in the pkg directory of your GAP directory. Then start GAP and enter: 

 LoadPackage( "Origami" );

## Needed packages

You need the following GAP packages, to use this package:

- ModularGroup Version 0.0.1 (https://AG-Weitze-Schmithusen.github.io/ModularGroup/)

- Orb Version 4.7.6 (this is a standard package)

To use the SageMath functions from the surface_dynamics package you also need the following packages:

- HomalgToCAS Version2018.06.15 

- IO_ForHomalg Version 2017.09.02

- IO Version 4.5.1

- RingsForHomalg Version 2018.04.04

## Using SageMath

There is a SageMath package "surface_dynamics" from Samuel Leli√®vre and Vincent Delecroix, which contains similar functionality as this GAP package. Our package includes an interface to SageMath, that allows to use calculations from the SageMath package surface_dynamics in a GAP session. To use them, SageMath  and the SageMath package surface_dynamics (https://pypi.org/project/surface_dynamics/) must be installed on your operation system.
