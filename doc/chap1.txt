  [1X1.1 [33X[0;0YOverview[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YThis  package  provides  methods  for  calculations with certain translation
  surfaces called origamis. An origami (also known as square-tiled surface) is
  a  finite  covering  of a torus which is ramified at most over one point. It
  can  be described in the following way from two permutations [22XÏƒ_x, Ïƒ_y âˆˆ S_d[122X.
  We take [22Xd[122X squares [22XQ_1, dots, Q_d[122X and glue the lower side of [22XQ_i[122X to the upper
  side  of [22XQ_Ïƒ_y(i)[122X and the right side of [22XQ_i[122X to the left side of [22XQ_Ïƒ_x(i)[122X. We
  require origamis to be connected and thus the group generated by [22XÏƒ_x[122X and [22XÏƒ_y[122X
  acts  transitively on [22X{1,...,d}[122X. In this package we identify an origami with
  a  pair  of  permutations,  which  acts  transitively  on [22X{1, dots, d}[122X up to
  simultaneous  conjugation.  This  corresponds to renumbering the squares. By
  choosing  a certain numbering in a canonical way one can achieve a canonical
  representative.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YWe  are  especially  interested  in the so-called Veech group of an origami.
  This  is  a  finite-index  subgroup  of  [22XSL_2(Z)[122X  which  carries  a  lot  of
  information  about  the  geometric  and dynamic properties of the underlying
  translation  surface. For further information about origamis and translation
  surfaces in general see e.g. [Zmi11], [Sch05], [HL06], [Ran17] and [Zor06].[133X

  [33X[0;0YSince  we  are  mainly  interested  in  Veech  groups of origamis, which are
  subgroups of [22XSL_2(Z)[122X of finite index, we fix two generators of [22XSL_2(Z)[122X[133X

  [124X
  
  [33X[0;0YFurthermore  we  fix  the  free  group  [22XF[122X generated by [22XtildeS[122X and [22XtildeT[122X. We
  consider  the  canonical  epimorphism  [22XÏ€:  F->  SL_2(Z)[122X with [22XÏ€(tildeS)=S[122X and
  [22XÏ€(tildeT)=T[122X.[133X
